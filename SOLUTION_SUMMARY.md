# Fix for ReplaceRegexTool Syntax Error Issue

## Problem Description

The `replace_regex` tool was causing syntax errors when processing strings containing newline escape sequences (`\n`). Instead of properly handling these escape sequences, the tool was inserting literal newlines into the code, breaking the syntax of string literals, particularly f-strings. This resulted in errors like:

```
print(f'
               ^
     SyntaxError: unterminated f-string literal
```

The issue was reported by multiple users across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), suggesting it was not platform-specific. The common factor was strings with newline escape sequences.

## Root Cause Analysis

After extensive testing, we identified that the issue occurred specifically when the replacement string contained a literal newline character rather than an escaped newline sequence. When such a string was passed to the `ReplaceRegexTool.apply` method, the literal newline was not being properly escaped, resulting in it being inserted directly into the output file.

This was particularly problematic for string literals, as it would break them across multiple lines, causing syntax errors.

## Solution

We implemented a two-step approach to fix the issue:

1. **Pre-process the replacement string** to explicitly replace any literal newlines with escaped newlines:
   ```python
   repl_with_escaped_newlines = repl.replace('\n', '\\n')
   ```

2. **Process the pre-processed string** with the existing `escape_backslashes` function to handle other escape sequences:
   ```python
   processed_repl = escape_backslashes(repl_with_escaped_newlines)
   ```

This ensures that:
- Literal newlines are properly escaped, preventing them from breaking string literals
- Other escape sequences are handled correctly
- Backreferences in the replacement string still work as expected
- The fix works regardless of how the replacement string is passed to the method (raw string, regular string, or through an API call)

## Testing

We created a comprehensive test suite that covers various edge cases:
- Basic newline escape sequence
- Already escaped newline
- Double escaped newline
- Mixed escape sequences
- Newline in JSON string format
- Literal newline in string
- Multiple newlines in complex string
- Newline in f-string with indentation
- Exact scenario from the issue description

All tests now pass, confirming that the fix properly handles all cases of newline characters in replacement strings.

We also ran the existing Python tests to ensure the fix doesn't break any existing functionality, and all tests passed successfully.

## Benefits

This fix:
1. Prevents syntax errors when using the `replace_regex` tool with strings containing newline escape sequences
2. Works consistently across all platforms
3. Handles all types of escape sequences correctly
4. Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
5. Provides a more robust and reliable regex replacement functionality

Users will no longer encounter the frustrating issue where newline escape sequences in replacement strings cause syntax errors in their code.
